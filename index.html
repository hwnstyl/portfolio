            Bio
            <p>
              I am a web developer and recent graduate of the Full Stack Flex boot camp at Thinkful.  In another life, I was a Mechanical Engineer.  Engineering at its core is problem solving... web development at its core is problem solving.  Problem solving is what I love about engineering and coding.  I'm really excited to start my career as a web developer.
              When I'm not coding, I can be found in my vegetable garden, under the hood of a car, or spending time with friends and family.  I live to learn.  My current areas of learning (besides code) include: cooking, nutrition, and essential oils.
