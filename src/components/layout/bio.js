                <h1>I'm a full stack web application developer, currently living in Georgia.</h1>
                Iâ€™m also a Mechanical Engineer. I have a Full Stack Web Development certificate from Thinkful and a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology.  Both web development and engineering, at their core, are problem solving & that is what I was made to do. I am self-motivated with a strong work ethic.

                When I'm not coding, I can be found wearing overalls in my vegetable garden, wearing overalls under the hood of a car, or wearing overalls spending time with friends and family. I like overalls. Furthermore, I live to learn. My current areas of learning (besides code) include: gardening, playing the ukulele, and essential oils.
